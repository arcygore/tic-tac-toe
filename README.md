# tic-tac-toe

Topics Learned & Strengthened:
- Module Pattern 
- IIFEs
- Factory Functions
- Scope
- DOM Manipulation
- Array methods

This is by far the most challenging project that I've had to complete for The Odin Project. I was able to get a 'functioning' game where the cells were auto generated with a "createBoard" function, and X and O could place their markers in succession to fill up the board, but the win/loss logic took me days. It's becoming increasingly apparent to me that array methods are going to be an incredibly important topic to understand, as the .every and .some methods were crucial to my solution of this project.

Once the win/loss logic was completed, the rest of the project went by with relative ease. I'm not entirely sure that I put the "Player assignment" block within the right area (main game function), but I put a note in the code where I didn't figure out a way to assign players/clear cells but in their own function. It's the same thing that happened with creating a separate resetBoard() method within the gameBoard IIFE. Maybe it shouldn't be an IIFE for that since it will be invoked multiple times.

All-in-all, the project took me just over a week to complete, with probably a total active time of about 15 hrs.
